greedy best first search

you need to choose the path that appears to be the most promising at each step, based on a heuristic evaluation function.

i will give you the real distance and also heuristic distance

you can change the params of any function add some and also delete some

you need to implement the greedy best first search algorithm using the provided real and heuristic distances.

you need to print the path generated by greedyBestFirst and also output the real cost

try to optimize the code for better performance and readability and time and space complexity.
