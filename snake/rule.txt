1. Game overview
This platform is a multiplayer online battle snake game. Players need to write algorithm programs to control the snake's movement and behavior through interfaces and play games with other players' programs. The core goal of the game is to maximize your score by obtaining food in a limited number of rounds while avoiding various risks. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score wins.

2. Game map
Map size: 40 × 30 tiles (width × height)
Coordinate system: The grid in the upper left corner is (0, 0), the x-axis is incremented to the right, and the y-axis is incremented downward.
3. Game entity
1. Snake
Initial length: 5 tiles
Move: Move one tile per tick. The snake consists of a head and a body, which moves along the path the head has taken.
2. Field items
Ordinary food: 1-5 points are provided, and the color of food with different points is different.
Grow beans: Increases the length of the snake by two blocks, does not provide a score, and has a value of -1.
Trap: 10 points are deducted after eating, and its value is -2.
4. Game mechanism
1. The growth of the snake
Score Increase: Every time the snake's score reaches a multiple of 20, the length will automatically increase by one square.
Direct Growth: Eating a growth bean will instantly increase the length by two blocks.
2. Shield system
Snakes are born with an initial shield that lasts for 10 game ticks.
Players can spend 20 points to actively activate the shield. Activating the shield is a decision-making action, and the game will stay in place.
The shield lasts for 5 game moments after activation, during which time the snake is immune to death from collisions (except for walls).
Actively activated shields have a cooldown of 30 game ticks.
3. Collision rules
Collision with an obstacle: the snake dies instantly. This rule has the highest priority and the shield is invalid
Collision with your own body: no effect, no death
Collision with other snake bodies:
Holding a shield: Immune to collisions, can safely pass through the opponent's snake's body
Without shield: The colliding party dies instantly
Snake head collides with snake head:
Both sides have shields: neither side is harmless
Only one side has a shield: The side without the shield dies
Neither side has a shield: both die at the same time
4. Food generation
An initial batch of food will be generated at the beginning of the game, and new food will be generated periodically every 3 playtime moments.
Life Cycle: Items on the field will disappear if they are not picked up for a long time.
Normal food: 60 game ticks
Growth Beans/Traps: 80 game ticks
Quantity limit: The maximum number of simultaneous food on the field is positively correlated with the number of currently alive snakes. When the limit is reached, natural food generation will be paused.
Death Transformation: After the snake dies, its body is converted into new food based on its score (each serving of food is worth up to 20 points until the score is exhausted).
5. Treasure chest mechanic
Treasure chest
Refreshes only in the mid and late games, with a maximum of two per game.
Its score is dynamically calculated and fixed based on the battle situation when refreshed, designed to provide catch-up opportunities for players who are lagging behind. The formula is basic score + (1st place score - non-1st place average score) * 0.6, and the final score is limited to between 30 and 75.
For snakes without keys, chests are a deadly obstacle that dies instantly when touched and their shields are nullified.
key
Synchronized with the treasure chest, the number is max(2, floor (number of surviving snakes / 2)), and the maximum is 4.
The snake head can be picked up by touching the key on the ground.
Drop Rules:
When the holder dies, the key drops at their head.
If you hold the key for more than 30 game ticks in a row, the key will automatically fall off the holder and appear on the side of its head.
Interaction rules: The snake head must touch the treasure chest while holding the key to successfully open it and obtain its full score. Once the chest is opened, all other keys on the field will disappear immediately.
6. Safe zone mechanism
The safe zone is the core active area in the game, and all players should try to keep their head in the safe zone.

The snake's head will die immediately once it is outside the safe zone. The body part of the snake can be temporarily outside the zone.
Turning on the shield temporarily makes you immune to damage outside the safe zone, but if the head remains outside the zone after the shield ends, you will still die immediately.
All newly generated food will only appear within the current safe zone. When the safe zone shrinks, the stock of food located outside the new safe zone disappears immediately.
The safe zone shrinks to the center of the map with the game stage as follows:
game stage game tick range contraction event final size final boundary (x_min,y_min) -> (x_max,y_max)
Early 1 - 80 Stable 40 × 30 (0,0) -> (39,29)
Intermediate 81 - 100 First contraction 34 × 26 (3,2) -> (36,27)
161 - 180 Second contraction 26 × 20 (7,5) -> (32,24)
Late 221 - 240 Final contraction 20 × 16 (10,7) -> (29,22)
241 - 256 Final Pattern
7. Game Phase
The game has a total of 256 game moments, divided into three stages, and the distribution of resources on the field at different stages is focused:

Early Stages (1 - 80 game ticks)
This stage focuses on initial development, mainly generating low-fraction foods and growing beans.
Food weight: 80% for regular food (1-3 points), 20% for growth beans.
Mid Stage (81 - 200 game ticks)
Introducing high-scoring food, traps, and refreshing the first chest, competition begins to intensify.
Food weight: Regular food (1-5 points) 78%, growth beans 12%, trap 10%.
Later stages (201 - 256 game ticks)
High risk and high reward, the battle situation is changing rapidly. Possibility to refresh a second chest.
Food weight: 80% for regular food (1-5 points), 5% for growth beans, 15% for traps.
5. Game end conditions
Reach the 256 game tick limit.
There were no snakes alive on the field.
